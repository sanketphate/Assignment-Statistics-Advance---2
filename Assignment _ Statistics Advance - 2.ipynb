What is a random variable in probability theory?\n","\n","A random variable is a numerical value determined by the outcome of a random experiment. It maps outcomes to numbers.\n","\n","\n","2. What are the types of random variables?\n","\n","\n","Discrete Random Variable: Takes specific, separate values (e.g., number of heads in 3 coin tosses).\n","Continuous Random Variable: Can take any value in a range (e.g., height, temperature).\n","\n","\n","\n","3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n","\n","Discrete distribution: Deals with countable outcomes.\n","Continuous distribution: Deals with uncountable, measurable outcomes.\n","\n","\n","4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n","\n","For continuous random variables, the Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of the variable taking a value within an interval. The area under the curve gives probability.\n","\n","\n","5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDFs?\n","\n","CDF gives the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a value.\n","PDF shows the probability density at a specific value (for continuous) or probability (for discrete).\n","\n","\n","\n","6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n","\n","A distribution where all n outcomes have equal probability.\n","Example: Rolling a fair die → P(1) = P(2) = … = P(6) = 1/6.\n","\n","\n","\n","7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n","\n","Only two outcomes: Success (1) or Failure (0)\n","Probability of success = p, failure = 1 − p\n","Mean = p, Variance = p(1 − p)\n","\n","\n","\n","8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n","\n","Models the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials with probability p.\n","Used in repeated yes/no experiments (e.g., 10 coin tosses).\n","\n","\n","\n","9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n","\n","Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space when events occur independently at a constant average rate λ.\n","Used in call centers, traffic flow, etc.\n","\n","\n","\n","10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n","\n","Every value in a given interval has the same probability density.\n","Example: Selecting a random number between 0 and 1.\n","\n","\n","\n","11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n","\n","Bell-shaped, symmetric about the mean\n","Mean = Median = Mode\n","Fully defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)\n","\n","\n","\n","12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n","\n","A normal distribution with mean = 0, standard deviation = 1.\n","Used for calculating Z-scores and making statistical inferences.\n","\n","\n","\n","13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n","\n","The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size n becomes large, regardless of the original distribution.\n","It allows us to use normal-based methods even for non-normal data.\n","\n","\n","\n","14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n","\n","It explains why the normal distribution appears frequently in statistics: averages of large samples from any distribution tend to be normally distributed.\n","\n","\n","\n","15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n","\n","Z-statistics help compare a sample mean to a population mean under the assumption of known variance.\n","Used to calculate p-values and test significance.\n","\n","\n","\n","16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n","\n","𝑍\n","=\n","𝑋\n","−\n","𝜇\n","𝜎\n","Z=\n","σ\n","X−μ\n","​\n","\n","X = observed value\n","\n","μ = mean\n","\n","σ = standard deviation\n","Z-score tells how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.\n","\n","\n","\n","17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n","\n","Point estimate: A single value used to estimate a population parameter (e.g., sample mean).\n","Interval estimate: A range (like a confidence interval) that likely contains the true parameter.\n","\n","\n","\n","18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n","\n","They provide a range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to lie, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).\n","\n","\n","\n","19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n","\n","Z-scores determine the critical values used to construct confidence intervals.\n","E.g., for 95% CI → Z ≈ ±1.96.\n","\n","\n","\n","20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n","\n","Z-scores standardize values across distributions, allowing comparison even when means and standard deviations differ.\n","\n","\n","\n","21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n","\n","Sample size is sufficiently large (typically n ≥ 30).\n","Samples are independent.\n","Population has finite mean and variance.\n","\n","\n","\n","22.
